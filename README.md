# Facial_Keypoints
I built a convolution neural network on the Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection data. I split the original data into a reduced training set and a validation data set with test_size of 0.2. A convolution neural network is the best type of neural network to analyze visual imagery. Convolutional neural networks differ from normal neural networks because convolutional neural networks operate over three dimensional space volumes. The data had three channels. It contained a red, green, and blue value for each pixel.
